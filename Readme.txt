The codes are for the educational purpose. Please do not
use these in your realtime apps. The codes written by 
me could be modified also. You are free to use the code
for educational purpose.

The codes contains how to write a RESTful API backend code
using Node and Express.js and MongoDB. For testing you could use Google POSTMAN.

NOTE: We are using MVC Architecture for Node Modules, since this is Server App so view
      is not required. View will be Web-App and Mobile App.

      Uploading this project in Github for education purpose only. This project shows
      how you can write your own REST API using Node, Express and MongoDB. More improvement
      could be done.
